# Uber Clone in React Native

Uber is the favorite transport service provider for many of us - and to be honest, I like their minimalistic App design.\
That was the reason why I built it - and to develop my React Native skills.

## Built with
* Redux
* Google Places API
* react-native-google-places-autocomplete
* Google Distance Matrix API
* react-native-maps
* react-native-maps-directions
* tailwind-react-native-classnames
* react-native-elements
* react-navigation

## Features
* Homescreen with Origin input
* Map screen with a beautiful Google Map and Destination input
* Stacked Map Screen with two markers (origin & destination) connected with a stroke and the options\
  of different Uber-Services with calculated travel time and prices

## Missing
* Uber Eats functionality is not included - it is just there for the optic. If someone wants to do this - feel free.
